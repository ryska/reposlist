### Repository list

This is a project that lists javascript react repositories from github api. User can use search as it is in github search, so you can either type in `cats` or `user:facebook`

### To run the project you need to:

1. Create a .env.local file in the root catalog and add a github token: `REACT_APP_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_token'`

2. `npm install`

3. `npm start`

4. Open `localhost:3000`

### Tests

To run tests please run `npm test`

### Improvements:

1. For this project I used material-ui. I could make it much prettier (obviously) and responsive, but for now you need to trust me I can do that (please).

2. UX improvements:

   a) Table is not very mobile friendly, but great for general data display. For this task I decided to leave it as is, but ux-wise it could work better.

   b) Implementing on press enter for search input.

3. File structure:
   This is very specific for every project and there are countless wars around that topic.

4. Linting files on pre-commit.

#### Enjoy and happy holidays ☃️
